# Composed Web Components Playground
Web components are served from microservices and composed 
together in a shell app for playing around with.

Dumb components simply render and so are served up from a public folder.

Smart components contain sensitive logic and so are served from secured routes.

## Running
1. `yarn open` the shell app.
1. `yarn start` the two microservices.
